# Optimal Road Network Design
 This project finds the most cost-effective way to connect multiple cities using Kruskal's Algorithm (Minimum Spanning Tree). It helps minimize road construction cost by selecting only the essential roads, avoiding loops, and visualizes the final road map using Python, NetworkX, and Matplotlib.
